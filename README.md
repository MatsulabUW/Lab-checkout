## Design

### Front-end

<!-- Short description of front-end build/design -->

### Data API (Back-end)

Create a Javascript Wrapper class to call several of the functions
we plan to implement for users:

- takeout supplies
- checkout information
- update product information
- this javascript wrapper class code will be hosted and called on by API requests

**Request Informations with examples:**
[GET] get information to load information on the website and apply search filters
[Parameters]
?type (string) = equipments
= supplies
?id = id of the equipment / supply
?action = getCategory
= getReservationList
[Returns] JSON
[POST] add / delete new tools, update status (availability, reservation, etc)
[Parameters]
?type (string) = equipments
= supplies
?id = id of the equipment / supply
?action = addNew
= delete
= reserve (from / until)
= update
= takeOut
[Returns] JSON

**Description:** handles Database calls to the microsoft azure server - creating a new supply / equipment - creating a new reservation - updating stock / availability information

**Example Response:**

```json
{
  [
    {
    item name: "Thermo Fischer beaker 500mL",
    item_descrip: "a very large beaker",
    last_updated: 5/12/2023,
    num_in_stock 10,
    unit_size: 500mL,
    item_location: Fridge drawer 201,
    location_descrip: On the lab bench on the right of the fridge,
    min_stock_replen: 3
    },
    {1},
    ....,
    {N}
  ]
}
```

**Error Handling:**

- Server side errors
  - If the item is out of stock or at low stock the program will throw an error
    preventing the user from checking out the supplies. Returns error message:
    {error: "No Supplies found"}
  - Same for if the equipment is not available for checkout.
- Client side errors
  - If the requst parameters are missing, client side error occurrs and returns
    error message: {error: "invalid request"}

### Database

Implement Several Databases using the following schema
using a Microsoft Azure Server:

### Equipment Tables

#### Equipment Catalog

Used by research users to log in/out equipment

```
CREATE TABLE Equipment (
  catalog_num varchar(100) PRIMARY KEY,
  gen_item_name varchar(100), -- maps to general name in spreadsheet
  specific_item_name varchar(150),
  item_room varchar(50),
  item_location_descrip varchar(100),
  item_status BOOLEAN FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Checkout(item_status)  -- string determines if an item is checked out
);
```

#### Equipment Appointment table

Table in charge of actually handling scheduling equiquipment checkout duration

```
CREATE TABLE Checkout (
  catalog_num varchar(100) PRIMARY KEY,
  item_status BOOLEAN PRIMARY KEY,
  last_checkout_date DATETIME,
  checkout_duration INT,
  checkout_due_by DATETIME,
);
```

#### Equipment Financials

Only accessible to admin accounts to look at current inventory levels

```
CREATE TABLE Equipment_financials (
  catalog_num varchar(100) FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Equipment(catalog_num),
  Vendor varchar(100),
  price float,
  funds_used varchar(100),
  Model_number varchar(100),
  Serial_number varchar(100),
  order_num varchar(100)
);
```

#### Supplies Table

Used so people can take out supplies from the shared inventory

```
CREATE TABLE Supplies (
  item_name varchar(100),
  item_descrip varchar(150),
  last_updated DATE FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Resupply(last_updated),
  num_in_stock INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Resupply(num_in_stock),
  unit_size VARCHAR(25),
  item_location VARCHAR(100),
  location_descrip VARCHAR(50),
  min_stock_replen INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Resupply(min_stock_replen)
);
```

#### Resupply Table

Keeps track of current inventory levels and other admin information

```
CREATE TABLE Resupply (
  item_name VARCHAR(100),
  num_in_stock INT PRIMARY KEY,
  min_stock_replen INT,
  price FLOAT,
  order_num VARCHAR(25),
  added_by VARCHAR(50),
  last_updated DATE PRIMARY KEY,
  Expiration_date DATETIME,
  Notes VARCHAR(250),
);
```
